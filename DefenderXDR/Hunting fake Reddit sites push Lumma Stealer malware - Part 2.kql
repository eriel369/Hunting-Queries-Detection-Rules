// Hunting fake Reddit sites push Lumma Stealer malware - Part 2

// https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hundreds-of-fake-reddit-sites-push-lumma-stealer-malware/

// A recent cybersecurity threat where hackers have created nearly 1,000 fake websites mimicking Reddit and WeTransfer. These fraudulent sites are used to distribute the Lumma Stealer malware, which is designed to steal sensitive information such as passwords and session tokens. The campaign highlights the ongoing risks posed by info-stealer malware, which can compromise both individual and organizational data. These fake websites were found by Sekoia researcher crep1x, who shared a complete list of web pages participating in the scheme. Using this list as a threat hunting basis, here is my second MDE  threat hunting KQL.
