// Social Engineering Attack Monitor - Teams & Emails

// Yesterday, Kevin Beaumont (known as the "Cyber Weatherman") shared his experience assisting several organizations in recovering from successful ransomware attacks. A common thread in these incidents was the use of social engineering tactics. Attackers conducted initial reconnaissance over the phone to gather contact details, then bombarded users with a flood of emails and Teams messagesâ€”sometimes thousands per hour. The custom KQL detection script below for DefenderXDR can provide early warnings of this type of social engineering attack.

// External Teams Tenant Spray Monitor

let TeamsTriggerThreshold = 5;
CloudAppEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(1h)
| where Application == @"Microsoft Teams"
| where ActionType == @"MessageSent"
| where AccountDisplayName has "@"
| where tostring(UncommonForUser) != "[]"
| extend ExternalTeamsTenantID = tostring(parse_json(RawEventData)["UserTenantId"])
| where isnotempty(ExternalTeamsTenantID)
| summarize Count=count() by ExternalTeamsTenantID
| where Count > TeamsTriggerThreshold

// External Inbound Email Spray Monitor

let EmailTriggerThreshold = 150;
EmailEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(1h)
| where EmailDirection == "Inbound"
| where DeliveryAction == "Delivered"
| summarize Count=count() by SenderFromAddress
| where Count > EmailTriggerThreshold

// Mitre ATT&CK
