Workers.dev is a domain used by Cloudflare Workers’ deployment services, while Pages.dev is used by Cloudflare’s Pages platform that facilitates the development of web pages and sites. Fortra’s SEA team has observed a 198% increase in phishing attacks on Cloudflare Pages, rising from 460 incidents in 2023 to 1,370 incidents as of mid-October 2024. With an average of approximately 137 incidents per month, the total volume of attacks is expected to surpass 1,600 by year-end, representing a projected year-over-year increase of 257%.
