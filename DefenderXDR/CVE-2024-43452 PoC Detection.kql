// CVE-2024-43452 PoC Detection

// As the year begins, we've encountered a second significant Windows exploit. A Proof of Concept (PoC) has been released for CVE-2024-43452, a Windows Registry Elevation of Privilege vulnerability (CVSS 7.5) affecting Windows 11 23H2. This PoC, created by Mateusz Jurczyk from Google Project Zero, was inspired by Gabriel Landauâ€™s research on registry vulnerabilities. (Link available in the comments)
