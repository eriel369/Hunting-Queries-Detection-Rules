// Detecting FIDO2 Passkey Abuseüî•

// Max Rozendaal from Secura has penned an insightful blog titled ‚ÄúAbusing FIDO2 Passkeys to Take Over Global Administrators in Entra ID.‚Äù In this post, he delves into a critical attack vector, demonstrating how Microsoft‚Äôs Graph API for provisioning FIDO2 passkeys could be exploited to gain control over accounts with high-level privileges. (Blog link will be shared in the comments.)
// To address this issue, I‚Äôve developed a Sentinel Graph API KQL threat detection script inspired by Max‚Äôs findings. You can download the KQL code from my SlimKQL GitHub Repository, which is highlighted on my LinkedIn profile. Just search for ‚ÄúDetecting FIDO2 Passkey Abuse.‚Äù

let AbusedRoleMonitor = dynamic(["Privileged Role Administrator", "Global Administrator"]);
